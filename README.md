# Trump

A compiled programming language built in Rust and LLVM with meme syntax inspired by the convicted felon, crypto bro, and AI slop gas man Mr. Donald J. Trump. Oh, he's also the greatest content president of all time.

P.S. the devs of this language are not politically active individuals (trust) \
This is no right-wing propaganda, just memes (trust)

## Development

Write trump code in `test_files/test.trump`

We don't write test cases. Only sore losers write test cases, and we're not losers. Instead, run this to debug stuff:

```
cargo run
```
